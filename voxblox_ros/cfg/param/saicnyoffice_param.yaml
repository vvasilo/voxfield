# TSDF integration
# 1) "simple"
#   The most straightfoward integrator. Every point in the pointcloud has a ray cast from the origin through it. 
#   Every voxel each ray passes through is updated individually. A very slow and exact approach.
# 2) "merged"
#   Rays that start and finish in the same voxel are bundled into a single ray. 
#   The properties of the points are merged and their weights added so no information is lost. 
#   The approximation means some voxels will recive updates that were otherwise meant for neighboring voxels. 
#   This approach works well with large voxels (10 cm or greater) and can give an order of magnitude speed up over the simple integrator.
# 3) "fast"
#   Rays that attempt to update voxels already updated by other rays from the same pointcloud are terminated early and discarded.
#   An approximate method that has been designed to give the fastest possible results at the expense of discarding large quantities of information. 
#   The trade off between speed and information loss can be tuned via the start_voxel_subsampling_factor and max_consecutive_ray_collisions parameters. 
#   This method is currently the only viable integrator for real-time applications with voxels smaller than 5 cm.

# About the patch_on and early_break settings:
#   Fastest operation can be achieved by setting patch_on=false and
